As a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Dharwad, I'm driven by a passion for pushing the boundaries of AI. With a strong academic foundation and diverse research experiences, I've delved into areas such as speaker diarization, energy-efficient CNN architectures, and sentiment analysis in stock markets. My work aims to develop innovative AI solutions that address real-world challenges.

Beyond academics, I actively contribute to the IIIT Dharwad community as the President of the Data Science and AI Society. My technical expertise spans various programming languages, AI frameworks, and big data technologies, enabling me to approach complex problems with a versatile skill set. As I continue my journey in AI, I'm excited about collaborating on projects that drive technological advancements and create meaningful impact.
